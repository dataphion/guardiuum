## Risks of not using Guardiuum (E2E Enterprise Data Governance)

Without Guardiuum, enterprises face numerous challenges:

#### Data Chaos

Without a centralized governance platform, data can become fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies that compromise decision-making and operational effectiveness. Multiple copies of same data might be stored in different places within the enterprise which might lead to secure data leakages.


#### Security Vulnerabilities

Lack of proper data governance can expose enterprises to security risks, including unauthorized access and data breaches, potentially resulting in significant financial and reputational damage. Currently enterprises must use the default authentication and authorisation mechanisms which are provided by the data platform which are rigid and not extensible to use the in-house enterprise authentication mechanism.

#### Compliance Risks

Failing to adhere to data governance and protection standards can result in hefty fines and legal repercussions, undermining your enterprise's credibility and trustworthiness.

#### Hindered AI Initiatives

In the absence of organized and well-governed data, AI and machine learning projects may suffer from poor data quality, leading to unreliable outcomes and hindering innovation.
